# optimal-binary-search-tree


a programin VS C++2017to implement the algorithm for the optimal binary search tree problem shown in class. Your program shouldfirst prompt the user for the totalnumber of keys. It then asks the user to enter the keys and the probability for each key (both are entered on one line). Your program then computes the Amatrix and the R matrix and displaysthem to the screen (ina2-dimensional fashion). The last thing your program does before itquits is to build the optimal binary search tree for the keys. The following shows a scenario of running a sample program, where user's inputs are represented in boldface.Enter the total number of keys: 3Enter the 3 keys separated by at least 1 space: johnadam maryEnter the probability for the 3 keys separated by at least 1 space: 0.2 0.7 0.1key1 = adamkey2 = johnkey3 = maryThe following shows the Amatrixand the Rmatrixcomputed, respectively.00.71.11.40.00.20.40.00.10.00111022030
